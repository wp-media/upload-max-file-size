== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with all servers and hosting providers? =

Yes, it works with all servers. But, please know that server adjusted limits can't be changed from a WordPress plugin. If the server set limit is 16MB you can't increase it to 128MB via WordPress. You have to email your hosting provider and ask them to increase the limit. Install the plugin and it'll tell you what the limits are and what to do.
